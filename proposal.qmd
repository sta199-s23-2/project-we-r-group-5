# Data 1

## Introduction and data

-   Write a brief description of the observations.

    -   The observation includes the personal information of billionaire such as their name, gender, demographics, and citizenship. It also include their company information such as name, industry, inherited, and founder.

## Research question

-   A well formulated research question. (You may include more than one research question if you want to receive feedback on different ideas for your project. However, one per data set is required.)

    -   

-   A description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.

    -   

-   Identify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?

    -   

## Literature

-   Find one published credible article on the topic you are interested in researching.

    -   

-   Provide a one paragraph summary about the article.

    -   

-   In 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.

# Data 2

## Introduction and data

-   Identify the source of the data.

    -   This data is from Washington Post.

-   State when and how it was originally collected (by the original data curator, not necessarily how you found the data).

    -   It was originally collected in 2015, when the Washington Post was trying to compile a database of every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty since Jan.1 2015.

# Data 3

## Introduction and data

-   Identify the source of the data.

    -   Data was collected from individual states as part of the NSDUH study.

-   State when and how it was originally collected (by the original data curator, not necessarily how you found the data).

    -   It was collected in 2021.

    -   This data collected from Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)'s public online data analysis system (PDAS).

-   Write a brief description of the observations.

    -   This dataset is about substance abuse (cigarettes, marijuana, cocaine, alcohol) among different age groups and states. Data was collected from individual states as part of the NSDUH study. The data ranges from 2002 to 2018. Both totals (in thousands of people) and rates (as a percentage of the population) are given.

## Research question

-   A well formulated research question. (You may include more than one research question if you want to receive feedback on different ideas for your project. However, one per data set is required.)

    -   From 2002 to 2018, how does drug use by population between alcohol, cocaine, tobacco, and marijuana vary by year?

-   A description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.

    -   Our research topic is understanding the curve and decrease/increase of certain drug use on the population from years 2002 to 2018 by year. We will compare the differing numbers of drug uses by year from 2002-2018, understanding the general trend of the data. From 2002-2018, there is likely to be an increase of substance users.

-   Identify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?

    -   Our data uses mostly quantitative variables to check the numbers of usage of the differing substances from 2002-2018.

-   **Towards explaining time trends in adolescents\' alcohol use: a multilevel analysis of Swedish data from 1988 to 2011**

    <https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckz023>

    Junhwan Kim, Brittany E Evans, Curt Hagquist, Towards explaining time trends in adolescents\' alcohol use: a multilevel analysis of Swedish data from 1988 to 2011, *European Journal of Public Health*, Volume 29, Issue 4, August 2019, Pages 729--735

-   Provide a one paragraph summary about the article.

    -   The authors use data from repeated cross-sectional surveys of Swedish high school students, analyzing the data using a multilevel approach to explore both individual-level and contextual-level predictors of alcohol use.The study found that the prevalence of alcohol use among Swedish adolescents decreased over time, and that this trend was particularly pronounced among girls. Individual-level factors such as gender, age, and parental education were found to be strongly associated with alcohol use, as were contextual-level factors such as school-level socioeconomic status and alcohol availability in the community.

-   In 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.

    -   In our data, we also will be comparing the trend of alcohol/drug usage over time and possibly predicting the contextual reasons behind it. However, we will not be using data from the US, not Sweden, and we will be looking across all age groups.
