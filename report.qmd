#### Introduction and data

Our topic focus on the dataset "Billionaires" (2016), which contains information on the Billionaires in the world in 1996, 2001, 2014. The dataset involves information on each billionaire such as their country, wealth worth, wealth type, industry, etc. Using some of these variables, we came up with a question that helps us gather more insight on the wealth world, which is helpful for those who are deciding which industry to enter in different countries.

Research Question and Hypothesis:

-   In 2014, how did the relationship between wealth worth and industry among the billionaires differ between each continent?

To answer our full question, based on our prior background knowledge, we predict that the industry of technology-computer will contain the most billionaires. More broadly, we hypothesize that some continents and industries will contain more billionaires than others. Additionally, we hypothesize that North America will have the most billionaires, followed by Asia. However, we also acknowledge that each continent is very different, so our prior background knowledge may only apply to North America, where we reside.

The data was from the CORGIS Dataset Project, collected by Ryan Whitcombwas in 1996, 2001, and 2014. We are only focusing on the data collected in 2014. It compiled Forbes World's Billionaires list and shows a record number of billionaires in the world while adding detailed information on the individuals listed. The relevant variables include the wealth worth, industry, and their continent. In total, the data set has 22 columns and 2614 observations. Specifically in 2014, it contains 1653 observations in 2014, the year we have chosen to focus our analysis on.

#### Methodology

Our methodology involves creating a table that counts the number of billionaires per continent in 2014. This gives us an overview of the numbers alone, industry aside. Next, in order to also compare industry and wealth worth, we thought it would be best to create a bar plot for each continent. Thus we used facet wrap to create multiple side-by-side plots that depict the relationship between industry and wealth worth.

billionaires <- read_csv("data/billionaires.csv")

df_1 <- billionaires|>
  filter(year == 2014)|>
  select(name, `wealth.worth in billions`, wealth.how.industry, location.region, location.citizenship)|>
  rename_with(~'wealth.worth.billions', `wealth.worth in billions`)|>
  mutate(continent = case_when(
    location.region %in% c("East Asia", "South Asia") ~ "Asia",
    location.region == "Middle East/North Africa" ~ "Africa",
    location.region == "Sub-Saharan Africa" ~ "Africa",
    location.region == "Latin America" & location.citizenship == "Mexico" ~ "North America",
    TRUE ~ location.region
  ))
```

```{r}
#| label: graphs

df_1 |>
  filter(wealth.how.industry != 0) |>
  ggplot(
    aes(x = wealth.how.industry, y = wealth.worth.billions, fill = wealth.how.industry)) +
    geom_col() + 
  facet_wrap("continent") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between Wealth Worth and Industry\nAmong the Billionaires in each Continent in 2014", 
       x = "Industry", 
       y = "Wealth Worth(billions)",
       fill = "Industry type") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14)) +
  theme(legend.text = element_text(size = 7)) +
  theme(legend.title = element_text(size = 13)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())

```

#### Results

-   To answer our research question, we created a plot to visualize the relationship between industry and wealth worth, with industry being on the x-axis and wealth worth in billions on the y-axis. Additionally, in order to compare these variables by continent, we used facet wrap to make multiple plots next to each other. This visualization made it easy for us to draw conclusions to our question.

-   From the table depicting the number of billionaires per continent in 2014, we found that overall, North America had the most billionaires (as our hypothesis stated), followed by Europe and then Asia. This does not line up with the prediction, as we had predicted Asia to come first. For industry, we found that technology-computer was in fact the industry with the most billionaires in North America. However, it was found that each continent had a very different turn out regarding which industry was the most successful. For Europe and Latin America, the industry with the most billionaires was the consumer industry; for Africa, the diversified financial industry; and for Asia, the real estate industry.
