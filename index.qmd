Our research project investigates the relationship between wealth worth and industry among billionaires in North America over time, using the "Billionaires" dataset (2016), which contains information from 1996, 2001, and 2014. In our research,we compared the number of billionaires and mean wealth worth per industry across the three years. Our findings revealed a noticeable rise in the number of billionaires across most industries and a significant increase in their average wealth worth. The data shows that the technology-computer industry consistently had the highest average wealth worth, whereas the diversified financial industry had the highest increase in average wealth worth over time. Additionally, changes in the dataset, such as the removal of the services industry and the addition of the venture capital industry, reflect broader trends in the rise and fall of certain industries.
