However, one per data set is required.)\n\nWhat is the relationship between wealth worth and industry among the billionaires in North America?\n\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\n\nThis research question will help us understand how the industry a billionaire works in affects their net worth in North America. We will look at all the different industries and see how those different industries lead to different net worths. Ultimately the goal is to find a trend that can help us determine which industries are more successful than others. We predict that some industries such as technology-computer, consumer, and money management will have higher rates of producing billionaires than others.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\n\nThe variable of industry (wealth.how.industry) is categorical and the variable of net worth (wealth.worth) is quantitative."

Finance and investments had the most billionaires with 267, followed by technology with 221, manufacturing with 215, real estate with 163, and fashion and retail with 135.

industry being on the x-axis and wealth worth in billions on the y-axis. Additionally, in order to compare these variables by continent, we used facet wrap to make multiple plots next to each other. This visualization made it easy for us to draw conclusions to our question.\nFrom the table depicting the number of billionaires per continent in 2014, we found that overall, North America had the most billionaires (as our hypothesis stated), followed by Europe and then Asia. This does not line up with the prediction, as we had predicted Asia to come first. For industry, we found that technology-computer was in fact the industry with the most billionaires in North America. However, it was found that each continent had a very different turn out regarding which industry was the most successful. For Europe and Latin America, the industry with the most billionaires was the consumer industry; for Africa, the diversified financial industry; and for Asia, the real estate industry.\n\nCitation and Reference\n\n“Billionaires CSV File” from the CORGIS Dataset Project.
