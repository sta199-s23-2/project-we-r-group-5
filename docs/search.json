Finance and investments had the most billionaires with 267, followed by technology with 221, manufacturing with 215, real estate with 163, and fashion and retail with 135.

Thus we used facet wrap to create multiple side-by-side plots that depict the relationship between industry and wealth worth.\n\n\nResults\nShowcase how you arrived at answers to your research question using the techniques we have learned in class (and beyond, if you’re feeling adventurous).\nTo answer our research question, we created a plot to visualize the relationship between industry and wealth worth, with industry being on the x axis and wealth worth in billions on the y axis. Additionally, in order to compare these variables by continent, we used facet wrap to make multiple plots next to each other. This visualization made it easy for us to draw conclusions to our question.\nProvide only the main results from your analysis. The goal is not to do an exhaustive data analysis (calculate every possible statistic and perform every possible procedure for all variables). Rather, you should demonstrate that you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them using data, that you are skilled in interpreting and presenting results, and that you can accomplish these tasks using R. More is not better.\nFrom the table depicting the number of billionaires per continent in 2014, we found that overall, North America had the most billionaires (as our hypothesis stated), followed by Europe and then Asia. This does not line up with the prediction, as we had predicted Asia to come first. For industry, we found that technology-computer was in fact the industry with the most billionaires in North America.
