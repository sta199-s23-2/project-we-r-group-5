    "text": "Our research project investigates the relationship between wealth worth and industry among billionaires in North America over time, using the “Billionaires” dataset (2016), which contains information from 1996, 2001, and 2014. In our research,we compared the number of billionaires and mean wealth worth per industry across the three years. Our findings revealed a noticeable rise in the number of billionaires across most industries and a significant increase in their average wealth worth. The data shows that the technology-computer industry consistently had the highest average wealth worth, whereas the diversified financial industry had the highest increase in average wealth worth over time. Additionally, changes in the dataset, such as the removal of the services industry and the addition of the venture capital industry, reflect broader trends in the rise and fall of certain industries."

    "text": "Methodology\nOur methodology involves multiple components. First, we found the number of billionaires per industry for each of the three years (1996, 2001, and 2014). Using this information, we can compare them and see how the number of billionaires has changed over time. Of course, this does not tell us anything about quantity of wealth, so in addition to the number of billionaires alone, we thought it would be beneficial to find the average wealth worth of the billionaires in each industry. We did this for all three years, and created a visualization to show how mean wealth worth has changed. From this, we can see the growth of certain industries as well as the diminish of others. Lastly, we conducted a hypothesis test for the general mean wealth worth, first for 2001 and 2014, and then for 1996 and 2001. We used the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in our data analysis because there were sample sizes greater than 30. A two-sample t-test was conducted to compare the change in mean wealth worth per billionaire across industries over time. These hypothesis tests tell us whether there was a true, significant change in mean wealth worth between those years. This is general, but could be done for the specific industries as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 17 × 2\n   wealth.how.industry             num_billionaires\n   <chr>                                      <int>\n 1 Consumer                                      86\n 2 Money Management                              58\n 3 Retail, Restaurant                            50\n 4 Media                                         42\n 5 Real Estate                                   42\n 6 Diversified financial                         24\n 7 Technology-Computer                           22\n 8 Constrution                                   16\n 9 Non-consumer industrial                       16\n10 Energy                                        15\n11 Technology-Medical                            14\n12 Mining and metals                             12\n13 Hedge funds                                    9\n14 Other                                          8\n15 banking                                        1\n16 Private equity/leveraged buyout                1\n17 services                                       1\n\n\n# A tibble: 16 × 2\n   wealth.how.industry             num_billionaires\n   <chr>                                      <int>\n 1 Consumer                                      94\n 2 Media                                         73\n 3 Money Management                              69\n 4 Retail, Restaurant                            57\n 5 Technology-Computer                           55\n 6 Real Estate                                   48\n 7 Energy                                        30\n 8 Constrution                                   20\n 9 Technology-Medical                            19\n10 Other                                         16\n11 Hedge funds                                   15\n12 Diversified financial                         11\n13 Mining and metals                             10\n14 Non-consumer industrial                        8\n15 Private equity/leveraged buyout                6\n16 Venture Capital                                3\n\n\n# A tibble: 16 × 2\n   wealth.how.industry             num_billionaires\n   <chr>                                      <int>\n 1 Consumer                                     291\n 2 Real Estate                                  190\n 3 Retail, Restaurant                           174\n 4 Diversified financial                        132\n 5 Technology-Computer                          131\n 6 Money Management                             122\n 7 Media                                        104\n 8 Energy                                        87\n 9 Non-consumer industrial                       83\n10 Technology-Medical                            78\n11 Mining and metals                             68\n12 Constrution                                   61\n13 Other                                         59\n14 Hedge funds                                   43\n15 Private equity/leveraged buyout               18\n16 Venture Capital                                5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(H_{0}= 2014-2001 \\le 0\\)\n\\(H_{a}= 2014 -

Among all industries, the technology computer industry has consistently shown the highest mean wealth worth over the three years. However, the greatest increase in mean wealth worth was observed in the diversified financial industry. It is also worth noting that the services industry was removed from the dataset in 2001, and this shows a decline in its overall success and profitability. On the other hand, the venture capital industry was added to the dataset in 2001, which shows its increase in overall success and profitability. Furthermore, the private equity/leveraged buyout industry experienced a dip in its graph (decrease in mean wealth worth), followed by an increase in later years.\nHowever, our hypothesis test does not fully agree that the mean general wealth worth has been consistently increasing. We found that the first dataset comparison (2001 vs. 2014) led to rejection of the null hypothesis, indicating an increase in mean wealth worth. However, the second comparison (1996 vs. 2001) did not provide conclusive evidence of an increase due to potential sample size differences and smaller increases during that time period. It is important to note that only the upper tail of the distribution was considered due to the alternative hypothesis testing greater than 0. Thus, our analysis does not support the conclusion that mean wealth worth per billionaire increased from 1996 to 2001.\n\n\nDiscussion\nSummary:\nFrom our research project, we learned that most industries grew due to the fact that both the number of billionaires within the industry increased as well as the mean wealth worth (not taking inflation into account though; will be discussed in next section). Changes in the dataset, such as the removal or addition of industries, can reflect broader trends in the overall success and profitability of certain sectors. The hypothesis test showed a significant increase in mean wealth worth per billionaire from 2001-2014 but not from 1996-2001. Keep in mind that this test was a generalization of total mean wealth worth for each year NOT considering industry. Future research can include more detailed hypothesis testing, such as conducting one for each of the industry. This leads into the next part of the discussion about limitations and future research.\nLimitations and future research:\nWe have 3 main limitations that we would like to include in this discussion.\n\nInflation: We did not consider the effects of inflation. Our model were based on the exact wealth worth in billion dollars in those years. We also anticipated that inflation can have a significant impact on wealth worth since 1996. We’d recommend future research does take in effect of inflation into account.\nHeritage: Some billionaires in our data set were inherited from their parents. Therefore their data may not accurately reflect their industry type.\nData from 1996, 2001, and 2014 are not enough for a comprehensive analysis. In order to form a more precise and accurate model, we’d recommend to include more data from not just 3 years but every consecutive year from the beginning to the end so that a better trend can be presented.\n\nCitation and Reference\n[1] “Billionaires CSV File” from the CORGIS Dataset Project.
